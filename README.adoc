= PHP Cardinal Collections

PHP Map and Set, but with anything as key.

== Features

Implements `ArrayAccess`, `Iterator` and `Countable` interfaces, so you can use it like you would a standard PHP array:

[source,php]
----
$a[] = ['foo' => 'bar'];
$value = $a[0];
unset($a[0]);
count($a);
foreach ($a as $key => $value);
----
